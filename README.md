If you don't have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed here's where you can find it.

## Install the dependenices
Use the npm package manager.
```bash
npm install
```

### How to run
First copy the .env-example to .env
```bash
cp .env-example .env
```
Then open the .env file in any text editor and add your ip address (on linux just run `hostname -I`)
You also may want to change the port, but that's purely optional.

Then you may start the application with this line
```bash
node .
```
If everything went good and the ip was correct the website is now working! üëç
